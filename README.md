## Running this site

### To clone files locally:

- First, run `git clone https://github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/ec15551/web-design-coursework.git` in a folder of your choice in terminal/cmd.
- Then navigate to this repository through terminal/cmd and type `git checkout gh-pages`
- This will change the files in your source repository to the ones in the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub uses to build the site from.

### Running it:

As we are using GitHub pages as our web server, there are no server files on the repository. This means to develop/view the site locally, one can simply open the relevant HTML pages from the folder they're stored in.

### GitHub repository

The GitHub repository for this site is [hosted here](http://www.github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/ec15551/web-design-coursework). It will require ITS login credentials to view the repo.<br>
We are using the `gh-pages` branch to host all code for the live site. The master branch does not contain relevant code for this assignment.

### Published Site URL

The published site is running at [this url](https://pages.github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/ec15551/web-design-coursework/). Users can access this through any web browser.
