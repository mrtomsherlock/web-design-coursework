## The Website
Currently less than 1 in 12 students in the UK between the ages of 15 to 18 are being advised to seek an apprenticeship after finishing school. (https://www.fenews.co.uk/press-releases/14720-yougov-poll-just-8-of-students-advised-to-seek-apprenticeships)

For degree apprenticeships the figures are most likely worse.

In response to this we have decided to create a website that informs school leavers of the advantages and opportunities linked with degree apprenticeships (DA's).

The website will be mainly informative, offering advice and guidance on the opportunities available for students across various sectors.

The website needs to be inviting and easy to understand as the aim it's ultimate aim is to try and convince users to sign up to one of the many DA opportunities.

## Users
A majority of DA applicants apply to join schemes directly after completing 6th form/ college.

As our website is aimed at prospective applicants it is safe to assume that our audience will mainly be between the age of 16-18. That being said we should still bear in mind that their is no age limit on applicants and that parents may still be involved in steering their child's future, so the website should be accessible to a wider audience.

DA's cover all sort of industry from soft skills such as project management and HR to sciences such as Civil Engineering and Computer Science. The diverse nature of the schemes available means we will most likely be catering to a multi gendered audience.

Teens in the US have been found to spend as much as 9 hours a day using media, i.e. mobile phones and the web, for their enjoyment. What we can take from this is that we will be dealing with an audience that is incredibly computer literate. This high level of IT literacy means we need to create a website that is as fast as it smooth and sleek. Individuals who use the internet a lot will be instantly turned off by a website that doesn't meet the current online style or respond to actions as they would expect.

It will also be important to take into consideration the fact that a vast majority of web traffic is now accessed through mobile devices rather than devices such as laptops and PCs. This is especially the case for those under the age of 25 . What this means, is that when designing the website we need to ensure it is just as useable on a mobile device as it is on a non-mobile device.

As the purpose of this website is to inform, we think it is fair to assume that visitors to the site will either have very little knowledge of DAs, if any. This is an important fact to take into consideration when designing the website as information needs to be easy to read and understand.

On the other hand, as well as being informative it is important that our website is engaging. If the in the pursuit of making it easy to understand it is made too simple and bland we will struggle to capture the audiences attention let alone convince them that DAs are a worthwhile path to follow. It has been proven in recent years that society's ever growing use of technology has lead to substantial decrease in the average humans attention span, especially in teens. This makes first impressions extremely important. If our website is not able to hold a persons interest it will struggle to achieve anything productive.

There are 5 main actions the website must be able to complete. Firstly, it must introduce users to the degree apprenticeship scheme and what it entails. Secondly, it would be good to provide users with story's of people who have completed/are currently completing DA schemes. Thirdly, the website should be able to show users what schemes are available, in doing this the site must be able to show the diversity of the schemes available and the various industries they cover. Fourthly, following on from informing users of the opportunities the website should enable to users to apply to the schemes that interest them the most.  Finally, the user should be able to contact the website owners if they have queries that the website has not been able to answer.


## Website Critique
### Website 1 -  "The Tech Partnership"
`www.thetechpartnership.com`  
This is an example of an existing site which has a similar purpose to our planned site. It's designed to inform various stakeholders about Degree Apprenticeships - Employers, teachers, Lecturers and Students. These options are selectable from the top navbar, and change the content when clicked on, clearly showing the differences in information for each.
For the user base that we have selected this is good - a prospective DA can look here and filter to show only necessary information for them. It may show too much information in some cases - for example the level of detail offered to employers is too much for a DA, and is unnecessary. This may be confusing, however the use of the top navbar stops unnecessary information from showing. The site would be very simple for a user to interact with, as the site has large, simple action points such as the "sign up" button on the front page, and large clickable cards below it to find out information about the different parts of it. This means that most of the site information can be accessed in a small number of clicks, shown by Buchanan et al. in "Improving WAP Usability Case Study". **reference here - http://ramb.ethz.ch/CDstore/www10/papers/pdf/p230.pdf** . This site also adheres to the Gestalt Design psychology, by effectively using Proximity to draw the eye to similar groups of content, and associating these through similarity. For our users, 16-18 year old school leavers, this enables them to scan through a page briefly, and quickly find the relevant information. For a student who may have a shorter attention span, or be very busy, this means they can access the main information easily. This is helped by the use of bright, primary colours, and clear text. The site is also very responsive, and scales suitably well in real time from a large widescreen monitor size, down to a much smaller mobile device, with no loss of content.
The main requirements of this site are to inform stakeholders about degree apprenticeships, and this site does it in a simple yet effective way that is still clear. Our planned site will be of a similar level of complexity, aiming to present information in a similar way, through proximity and symmetry of information on cards.
##### Key activities:
* Comprehensive information on degree apprenticeships & more for employers, teachers, Lecturers and students
* News Sections to cover latest news & events realating to Degree Apprenticeships
* Links to other information, twitter feeds & contact details

### Website 2 -  "Degree Apprenticeships | Prospects.ac.uk"
`www.prospects.ac.uk`  
This is another example of a higher education information site. The prupose of it is not to explicitly advertise Degree Apprenticeships to site visitors, but to instead explain their options to them through lots of information and case studies. This leads to a very information-heavy page, formed almost entirely of text, with only a few breaks in this text, with most of these being subtitles that lead to more text. The main page has a top navbar, which is filled with links that lead to other parts of the site. There is also a right navbar that has links to the different sections of the current information page. This takes up a lot of screen space and means that, on a larger screen, the page is poorly optimised; the body text is in a narrow column down the center, with the navbar taking up space on the right, and lots of whitespace on both the left and right. On mobile, this is better optimised as the whitespace is reduced, however, lots of unnecessary space is taken up by a large navbar menu. The site is still very text heavy, which means our users will lose interest and will not bother scrolling through all the content. It is also not laid out in an intelligent way, offering only a large block of text to show information.On mobile, as the site is non-responsive, it fits better onto a mobile phone/tablet screen. With late 2016 being the first time that more than 50% of internet users access webpages from mobile devices, this is a good move as it will allow for a majority of users to view the site correctly **reference here - http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide**. For our site, which users will access on both web and mobile,  this is a poor use of space, and will lead to users not taking in all the information, and therefore the website will have failed in it's purpose by not informing the users correctly. We will instead aim for a responsive site to cater for both.   
This is not what we desire in our website, so we will not use a centre text column on the site. The website is also much less interactive than we desire. There is an option to jump to sections through the right menu bar, however the text flows in an order that requires the user to read all the text in order, so this is not effectively used, This means that in terms of interactivity, scrolling via the mouse or finger is the only way to move around the page, simply scrolling to view more text. The theme of the site is plain, using simple muted shades of grey. Emphasis is created by using pink coloured text and buttons, however this does not detract from the overall plain site design, and it detracts from the modern styled theme of the site. Overall it is very information heavy and does not have a clear flow.

* Information on degree apprenticeships & more for prospective students
* Case studies of current students to gain information
* Some links to other information, twitter feeds & contact details

### Website 3 -  "Degree Apprenticeships | getmyfirstjob.com"
`www.getmyfirstjob.com`
This is the third example of a similar website. It's purpose is also to inform it's target audience of the virutes of doing a degree apprenticeship. From our analysis, we estimate that this site's target audience will be school leavers, aged 16-25. The website re-iterates this by using simple primary colours. The text is laid out in a similar way to the prospects.ac.uk site, with a large block of center text containing the primary content. Use of space is better, with the menu bar taking up less space, and there being less white space. This is better overall, allowing for a more efficient use of screen space on all screen sizes. Lower down, to differentiate between content specific to different industries, clickable boxes are used, which dynamically displays different content. Gestalt's principles are used effectively here, by using proximity of the boxes to associate them as variations on the same theme. Symmetry is used to display this in a pleasant way for the user, and draw the eye to them as a whole. Content on the whole is organised in an efficient way, except for in the footer, which contains a large amount of unnecessary information and empty space. A better way to do this would be to split out the information (for example on partners) onto a separate page/section, or to make it much smaller. There is also an issue with this footer when scaling or on mobile, meaning it is unreadable. Overall, in critiquing this site, it is clear that it uses a better web design than several others, but has a few bugs which can occasionally render it impossible to read some content.

* Industry Specific information in more detail
* Links to other information, twitter feeds & contact details as well as how to apply

## Initial Sketches & wireframes
The first stage of our design was to design a suitable logo. We opted to use one wimilar to the official apprenticeships logo, but added nods to Degree Apprenticeships, and the inferred sun logo, implying a bright future for apprentices.

The second stage was to establish a colour palette to use as our house style. To do this, we chose colours that would fulfil these requirements:
* Complementary to the logo
* Complementary to each other
* Scalable, readable and renderable
* Modern feel - using "flat" material colours

The palette we have decided upon is this:


![palette](https://github.research.its.qmul.ac.uk/ec15551/web-design-coursework/blob/master/images/palette.png "planned colour palette")

Using a combination of muted reds, blues and greens, we have sected colours that adhere to our requirements and allows for the site to still be readable through various visual impairments & print layouts (including black & white)



The next step was to draw 5 low-fidelity sketches of potential sites. This took in the main activities as requirements and allowed us to share basic ideas. From this, we came up with 5 sketches as designs:
1. Basic familiar site. This has a simple layout using rigidly ordered content to allow for easy reading. It has a mix of images and text in simple blocks, allowing for a symetrical site that uses proximity and similarity to organise content.
2. Text based site - using large blocks of text to display information. A top navbar will be persistant, allowing for a continuous reference to other parts of the site.  
3. Alternative layout site - using the logo as a centerpoint, and a mouse/touch focussed navigation to change visible content. This will capture the attention of the user and will be unique, however could lead to long loading times and harder navigation for unfamiliar users.
4. Rigidly structured site with deep navigation tree - similar to site 1, this site will use multiple pages arranged in a strict hierachy to split content. This will lead to the most organised content, however may lose user's attention due to needing more clicks to navigate.
5. Image focused site with modern designs - this is a variation on site 1, using a series of central images as a continuous theme for the user. This would be done in the form of background or card images, which break up the large bodies of text.

We then conducted some basic user testing, with our group looking critically over the designs and taking the best parts from each of these.  
From this, we were able to draw some conclusions:

- smaller text blocks to avoid overloading users
- flat navigation structure
- images to illustrate ideas and encourage continuity
- muted but firm colours

After completing the low fidelity sketches we took what we had learnt and created 3 high fidelity wireframe sketches for possible website designs. Below are our findings.

Design 1 (Appendix B - Design 1) - This website design draws on some long standing principles and layouts that can be found all over the internet. A static navbar is placed at the top of the page allowing for simple and easy navigation. Related items are grouped together using design principles such as proximity and symmetry.

Pros -
* Extensive use of images to capture attention
* Simple navigation, with very few clicks to completion
* Simple layout that is easy to read
* No real update needed to port website to mobile browsers

Cons -
* Basic design that is not very inspiring
* Still very text heavy
* The over use of this template across the internet means the website wont be very unique, so will probably not be very engaging

Design 2 (Appendix B - Design 2) - This design currently follows the 'one page' design pattern that is very popular at the moment. This design consists of a very tall front page that is split into sections. As the user scrolls through the page they move through different areas of the site.  Links at the top of the page are fixed to the top of the browser and when clicked scroll the page to the section that relates to them.

Pros -
* Follows a very modern and popular template
* Good mix of images, text and shapes to keep the user engaged
* Easy to navigate

Cons -
* Users can get lost in a page that seems to have no end
* Content at the end of the page could be missed as users begin to get bored of scrolling through the page
* Website would need some work done on it to make it just as useful on mobile devices

Design 3 (Appendix B - Design 3)- This website design is focussed on interactivity and being cutting edge. The design itself is completely unique, the lack of any header and navbar gives the website an air of fluidity with no recursive base item framing the pages. The design is mainly based on images and interactive graphics.

Pros -
* Design is completely unique, helping it stand out to the user
* The various interactive sections will help keep the user engaged

Cons -
* Design will take a lot of work to port to mobile devices
* Focus on graphics rather than text may reduce the depth of information given


## Final Design 1
The first final design draws on the third high fidelity drawing. A copy of the paper prototype can be found in Appendix C. The design itself is unique and very interactive. As we found in our requirements capture the design needs to be engaging and smooth to tackle issues related to attention spans. The uniqueness of this design and its use of graphics and images throughout will help it to stand out on the web. The structure of the site is also incredibly simple. A menu button is positioned in the top righthand side of the page, and once clicked it opens the full screen four panel menu that you can navigate the entire site with. The driving force behind this design is the strive for simplicity, a single menu with no nested items allows the user to quickly navigate to the information they need with relative ease.
### Testing
When testing the website, we gave the users three separate tasks:
##### Scenario 1: You have knowledge of degree apprenticeships, but you want to know what it really means before going any further.  
Response: The response of the users to this this scenario highlighted a slight change to the design that needed to be made. Around half of the users navigated to other pages before finding the ‘Our Story’ page held the information they wanted. A change of title to ‘Case studies’ or a brief description on the menu would probably negate the issue. Once on the page all the users could follow the onscreen instruction to choose a story and then used the horizontal scrollbar to take them through the timeline.  
##### Scenario 2: You like IT but you want to know what course you would be able to join.  
Response:  The response to this scenario was very positive. All the users instantly chose the ‘Opportunities’ item and when shown the interactive mind map of courses clicked through to the IT section. From there they then browsed through the available courses by clicking on the separate employer buttons.   
##### Scenario 3: part A - You don’t know anything about Degree Apprenticeships, but you want to find out more. Part B - You have read the information but still have some questions.   
Response: This scenario was used to test how easy it is to navigate the site. All the user instinctively went to the correct page. However, when give part B some struggled to find the way out. This would be alleviated in a final design as the color of the menu button would help it stand out. Once they had found the menu all of the users clicked through to the ‘contact us’ page and sent a message. However, some of the users pointed out it would be nice to have a confirmation message once the message was sent.   

## Final Design 2

The second final design can also be found in the appendix. Using information from our requirements gathering stage, we opted for a single page site, accessed by users scrolling down to access more content. This is both simple to read, and makes all content accessible on the same page. It also uses Similarity to group content on each "scrolL" of the page. After looking at our lo-fi prototypes, we took the best parts of each of these and formed this second design - flat structure, clear simple images, a modern "material design" feel, , and small text blocks to keep content clear & concise. The user can quickly access content by clicking links on the top right of the homepage, or they can scroll down to view it. The site is interactive through using clicable cards to dynamically show/hide more content, which stops an information overload from occuring, something that was noted during our requirements gathering stage.

After several iterations, (see appendices), we developed a paper prototype we were happy woith, which best represents our planned features. We plan for the colour scheme to adhere to the one set out above, which uses material design to create readable and complementary colours, without being too garish or bright for users. The site will also feature the logo where needed, e.g. on the footer, on the top navbar, and on any help pages.

Overall, this allows the users to fulfill almost all of the tasks identified in the requirements gathering stages, and we have laid these out in a logical way - firstly the user will find out the basic information, then through further scrolling they will find out out more details e.g. industries. More specific information can be clicked on, whilst irrelvant information is hidden, and lastly links to apply are available at the bottom.

### Testing
##### Scenario 1 - You are a student/6th former and have no knowledge of degree apprenticeships, but wish to find out more
The user navigates to the site and is presented with the front page with insightful text and image. We found our testers paused on here, then clicked onto the start button to scroll down. This led them onto the basic information page, which presents them with the information needed. This would have 3 columns and contain small text blocks of information. For some users, this would be enough information, but for others they may wish to find some more information. To do this, they can scroll down to view which industries are hiring apprentices, or scroll further to view case studies from current apprentices. This would cover all the basic information for the casual viewer. The site will remain in it's initial state, just scrolling through different sections of the homepage.
##### Scenario 2 - You have an idea of wanting to do a degree apprenticeship, but want to find out some industry-specific knowledge
Again, the user will start with the site in it's initial state, landing on the homepage. The user may have visited the site before, so will have some familiarity with it. They can use the top right links to quickly navigate to the specific part of the site they want - the industry section. They will be presented with the cards showing several images with the industry titles, which are clickable. The user would then make the decision to click on the relevant card for their industry. This would then bring up a full screen card displaying detailed information. They can read this at their leisure and click the close button to exit. They are returned to the original screen, and can click onto another card to view more information. When tested with some users, they were able to navigate to this and glean the relevant information very quickly.
##### Scenario 3 - You want to make an informed choice about a degree apprenticeship by hearing from a current DA, and then want to apply
With the 3rd scenario, an experienced navigator of this site, the user was asked to find out complex information and apply to join a scheme. They are presented with the home page and most used the top navbar to get to the case studies. Some others also scrolled down to the same content. On arriving at the content they were presented with the card content, clicked onto the card and then were able to watch the video. This meant the user can view more informtion easily. There was then a minor issue with accessing the "apply" button, as it is contained within the industry specific card. To do this, the users had to scroll back up, click on the relevant industry, and view the button. This presented the user with the clickable card, and then they clicked onto the apply button.
